title.question.poor_data_validation = What is Poor Data Validation?

paragraph.info.1 = Poor Data Validation occurs when an application does not validate submitted data correctly or sufficiently. Poor Data Validation application issues are generally low severity, they are more likely to be coupled with other security risks to increase their impact. If all data submitted to an application is validated correctly, security risks are significantly more difficult to exploit.
paragraph.info.2 = Attackers can take advantage of poor data validation to perform business logic attacks or cause server errors.
paragraph.info.3 = When data is submitted to a web application, it should ensure that the data is strongly typed, has correct syntax, is within length boundaries, contains only permitted characters and within range boundaries. The data validation process should ideally be performed on the client side and again on the server side.
